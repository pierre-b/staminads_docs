## Metrics

### Session Metrics

| Metric | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `sessions` | Total number of sessions | `1,234` |
| `median_duration` | Median session duration in seconds (**TimeScore**) | `38.0` |
| `avg_duration` | Average session duration in seconds | `45.3` |
| `bounce_rate` | Percentage of sessions under bounce threshold | `34.56%` |
| `pageviews` | Total pageviews across all sessions | `3,456` |
| `pages_per_session` | Average pages viewed per session | `2.81` |
| `median_scroll` | Median max scroll depth percentage | `72.0%` |
| `max_scroll` | Average max scroll depth percentage | `67.2%` |
| `median_page_duration` | Session-weighted median time on page (seconds) | `23.0` |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="About TimeScore (median_duration)">
    The primary engagement metric in Staminads. Represents the median time users spend actively engaged in a session.

    **Why median?** Medians are resistant to outliers. A single visitor leaving a tab open for hours won't skew your data.

    **Example:** If sessions have durations `[10, 20, 30, 120, 300]`, the median is `30s` (not `96s` average).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="About Bounce Rate">
    Sessions shorter than the bounce threshold (default: 10 seconds) are considered "bounces."

    The threshold is configurable in workspace settings. Lower bounce rate is generally better.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="About median_page_duration">
    **Session-weighted**: Each session contributes equally regardless of page count.

    Useful for comparing engagement quality across traffic sources. Different from `page_duration` (pages table) which is page-weighted.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Page Metrics

| Metric | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `page_count` | Total page views | `5,678` |
| `unique_pages` | Number of unique page paths | `42` |
| `page_duration` | Median time on page in seconds | `28.0` |
| `page_scroll` | Median scroll depth percentage | `65.0%` |
| `landing_page_count` | Number of landing page views | `1,234` |
| `exit_page_count` | Number of exit page views | `1,234` |
| `exit_rate` | Percentage of views that are exits | `45.67%` |

<Tip>
**Exit rate context matters:**
- High exit rate on checkout page = problem
- High exit rate on "thank you" page = expected

## Metrics We Don't Support

Staminads is built on a fundamental principle: **we won't show you data we can't measure accurately**. Some metrics that other analytics tools display are technically impossible to track reliably in a cookieless, privacy-first world. Rather than showing you misleading numbers, we don't include them at all.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Users / Unique Visitors" icon="user-slash">
    **Why we don't support it:** Counting unique users requires identifying the same person across multiple sessions. Without cookies or persistent identifiers, this is technically impossible.

    A person visiting from their phone, then their laptop, then their work computer appears as three separate visitors. There's no privacy-respecting way to link these sessions.

    **What to use instead:** `sessions` — the number of sessions is accurate and meaningful. Focus on session quality (TimeScore) rather than trying to count people you can't identify.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Returning Visitors" icon="arrow-rotate-left">
    **Why we don't support it:** Identifying returning visitors requires recognizing someone who visited before. Without cookies, we can't know if a session is from a new or returning visitor.

    **What to use instead:** Focus on engagement metrics. A highly engaged session (high TimeScore) often indicates familiarity with your content, regardless of whether we can technically label it as "returning."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ROAS / ROI / Conversion Attribution" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    **Why we don't support it:** Return on Ad Spend requires tracking conversions back to the ad click that caused them. This is broken for multiple reasons:

    - **Cross-device journeys** — Someone clicks an ad on mobile, converts on desktop
    - **Multi-touch attribution** — Multiple channels contribute to a conversion
    - **Cookie restrictions** — Safari limits cookies to 7 days, adblockers delete them
    - **Consent requirements** — Users who decline tracking can't be attributed

    Your ROAS numbers in other tools are incomplete — they only count conversions they can track, which is a shrinking percentage of actual conversions.

    **What to use instead:** TimeScore and engagement metrics. Measure whether your ads bring engaged visitors. Engagement is measurable on every session, not just the ones that happen to convert within a trackable window.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
This isn't a limitation of Staminads — it's a limitation of the modern web. Any tool claiming to accurately count unique users or attribute conversions without cookies is either using fingerprinting (privacy-invasive) or showing you incomplete data. We choose transparency over false precision.
</Note>
