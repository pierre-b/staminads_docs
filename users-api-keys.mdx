Control who has access to your workspace and manage API keys for programmatic access to your data.

## Team Members

Invite team members to collaborate on your workspace. Each member is assigned a role that determines their permissions.

Invitations expire after 7 days. You can resend or revoke pending invitations from the Team settings page.

## API Keys

API keys allow programmatic access to Staminads for sending events, querying analytics, and managing workspace configuration.

### Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Select the appropriate role (determines scopes)
5. Optionally set an expiration date
6. Copy the key immediately — it won't be shown again

<Warning>
API keys are only displayed once at creation. Store them securely. If you lose a key, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

### API Key Roles

| Role | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Admin** | Full API access | Backend integrations, automation |
| **Editor** | Track events and manage analytics | SDK integration, data pipelines |
| **Viewer** | Read-only analytics access | Dashboards, reporting tools |

### Scopes

Each role grants a specific set of scopes:

| Scope | Description | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
|-------|-------------|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
| `events.track` | Send session and event data via SDK | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `analytics.view` | Query analytics data | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `analytics.export` | Export analytics data | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `workspace.read` | Read workspace configuration | ✓ | | ✓ |
| `filters.manage` | Create and manage filters | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `annotations.manage` | Create and manage annotations | ✓ | ✓ | |

### Key Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Key is valid and can be used |
| **Expired** | Key has passed its expiration date |
| **Revoked** | Key was manually disabled |

### Revoking Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Find the key and click **Revoke**
3. Confirm the action

Revoked keys are immediately invalidated and cannot be restored.

<Tip>
Create separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production) and integrations. This makes it easy to rotate keys without affecting other systems.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

- **Use the minimum required role** — Don't use Admin keys when Viewer access is sufficient
- **Set expiration dates** — For temporary integrations, set keys to expire automatically
- **Rotate keys regularly** — Periodically create new keys and revoke old ones
- **Never commit keys to version control** — Use environment variables or secret managers
- **Monitor usage** — Check `last_used_at` to identify unused keys that should be revoked
