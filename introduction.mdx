Stop chasing conversions you can't track. Start measuring **engagement** you can trust.

Staminads is an open-source, self-hosted analytics platform that measures traffic quality through engagement — not conversions. No cookies, no consent banners, 100% of your traffic captured.

<Warning>
**What we don't measure:** Staminads doesn't provide "unique users" or "visitor counts." Accurate user counting requires cross-device identity reconciliation — knowing that the same person visited from their phone, laptop, and work computer. This is technically impossible without invasive tracking or logged-in user data. Other tools showing these numbers are displaying estimates at best. We don't do fake metrics — if we can't measure it accurately, we don't show it.
</Warning>

## Why Staminads?

### The Problem: Conversion Tracking is Broken

Web marketers have relied on conversion tracking (ROI, ROAS) for years. But due to technical and legal constraints, **this approach no longer works**:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Technical Barriers" icon="ban">
    - Adblockers blocking tracking scripts
    - Limited cookie lifespans (7 days on Safari)
    - Cross-device journeys impossible to track
    - App webviews breaking attribution
  </Card>
  <Card title="Legal Constraints" icon="scale-balanced">
    - GDPR consent requirements
    - Cookie banner fatigue (users opt out)
    - Privacy regulations tightening globally
    - First-party data limitations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Your conversion data is incomplete. You're optimizing campaigns based on a fraction of reality.

### The Solution: Engagement-Based Analytics

Conversions don't happen in one visit. **Engagement does.**

A typical customer journey looks like this:

| Visit | Intent | What You Can Measure |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Research | ✅ Engagement |
| 2 | Compare | ✅ Engagement |
| 3 | Decide | ✅ Engagement |
| 4 | Convert | ❌ Often lost to tracking gaps |

The role of marketing isn't to convert — it's to **move the buying process forward**. Staminads measures what matters at every step: how engaged your visitors are.

## Core Concepts

### TimeScore

The **TimeScore** is the median time spent on your website for each traffic source, expressed in seconds.

Why median instead of average? Because medians are resistant to outliers — a single visitor leaving a tab open for hours won't skew your data.

<Note>
TimeScore measures real engagement. A visitor who spends 4 minutes reading your pricing page is more valuable than one who bounces after 10 seconds — regardless of whether they convert today.
