## Use Cases

- **Find high-performing traffic sources** — Identify new sources with top TimeScores
- **Optimize landing pages** — Detect which pages have the best engagement for a given campaign
- **Audit expensive campaigns** — Measure the traffic quality of high-spend campaigns
- **Device analysis** — Find out the impact of device types on engagement
- **Channel comparison** — Compare TimeScores across your marketing channels

## How It Works

1. **Select dimensions** — Choose what to group by (source, landing page, device, etc.)
2. **Apply filters** — Narrow down to specific traffic segments
3. **Sort by metrics** — Order by sessions, TimeScore, bounce rate, etc.
4. **Drill down** — Click any row to add it as a filter and explore deeper

<Tip>
Start broad (e.g., by channel) then drill down into specific dimensions to understand what drives engagement. The best insights often come from unexpected combinations.
