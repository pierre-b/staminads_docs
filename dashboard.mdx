## Date Range & Comparison

Use the date picker to select a time period for analysis. Available presets include Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, and custom ranges.

Enable **comparison mode** to overlay the previous period on charts and show percentage changes on KPIs. This helps identify trends and measure performance over time.

## Key Metrics

The top row displays your main KPIs:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sessions** | Total number of sessions in the selected period |
| **Median TimeScore** | Median session duration — your core engagement metric |
| **Bounce Rate** | Percentage of single-page sessions below the bounce threshold |
| **Pages / Session** | Average number of pages viewed per session |

Click any metric to switch the time-series chart to that metric.

## Time-Series Chart

The main chart visualizes your selected metric over time. Features include:

- **Granularity selector** — Switch between hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly views
- **Period comparison** — Overlay previous period data when comparison mode is enabled
- **Annotations** — Vertical markers for significant events you've added

## Widgets

The dashboard includes several widgets to break down your traffic:

| Widget | Tabs | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Top Pages** | Landing pages, Exits | Most visited entry and exit pages |

| **Countries** | Map, List | Geographic distribution of visitors |

### Click-to-Filter

Click any row in a widget to instantly filter the entire dashboard by that value. For example:
- Click a channel to see only traffic from that channel
- Click a country to focus on that geographic region
- Click a landing page to analyze traffic to that specific page

Click the same row again to remove the filter. Active filters appear below the date picker.

## Real-Time View
