To group together your traffic sources, and analyze their performance, you can map them to your marketing channels.

<Note>
  By default, a list of common traffic sources is already created for you (Google SEO, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, etc...). However **it is important to map your significant traffic sources** to your marketing channels, otherwise they will be grouped as "not mapped".
</Note>

## Structure

A channel belongs to a **group**, and a group can have multiple channels.

Each channel contain a list of **filters** that will be applied to match the traffic sources.

In case of overlap, the channel having the highest priority will be applied.

A filter is made of a list of dimensions (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, landing_path, utm_id_from) with a condition (contains, match...).

## UTM parameters

UTM parameters are a set of parameters used in URLs to track traffic sources and campaigns. They are the core pillars of digital marketing measurement.

| UTM Parameter | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| utm_source | Identifies the source of your traffic (e.g., google.com, facebook.com, mybusiness.com) |
| utm_medium | Indicates the marketing medium (e.g., referral, ads, cpc, email, social) |
| utm_campaign | Specifies the specific campaign name (e.g., black-friday-2025) |
| utm_term | Used for paid search to note the keywords for this ad |
| utm_content | Differentiates similar content or links within the same ad or page (e.g., ad-v1, ad-v2) |

### Example

For an emailing campaign, the UTM parameters will be:

- utm_source: `mybusiness.com`
- utm_medium: `email`
- utm_campaign: `black-friday-2025`
- utm_content: `email-v1` / `email-v2` ... if you do A/B testing

For a paid Instagram campaign, the UTM parameters will be:

- utm_source: `instagram.com`
- utm_medium: `social` or `ads`
- utm_campaign: `black-friday-2025`
- utm_content: `black-friday-2025-v1` / `black-friday-2025-v2` ... if you do A/B testing

For a Search paid campaign, the UTM parameters will be:

- utm_source: `google.com`
- utm_medium: `ads`
- utm_campaign: `black-friday-2025`
- utm_term: `[your keywords]`
- utm_content: `black-friday-2025-v1` / `black-friday-2025-v2` ... if you do A/B testing

### Staminads extra dimensions
| Parameter | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| utm_id | Staminads stores the ad-networks click IDs (Google Ads `gclid`, Meta `fbclid`...) in the `utm_id` dimension in the Staminads database. |
| utm_id_from | Staminads stores the origin of the `utm_id` in the `utm_id_from` dimension in the Staminads database (e.g., `gclid`, `fbclid`, `msclkid`...). |

Example: 

A click on a Google Ads campaign will generate a landing-page URL similar to `https://www.yourdomain.com?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=black-friday-2025&gclid=Cj0KCAiAxea5BhBeEi0Ah4t5K1MSznUElMY`.

In this case the `utm_id` dimension will be `Cj0KCAiAxea5BhBeEi0Ah4t5K1MSznUElMY` and the `utm_id_from` dimension will be `gclid`.

## Brand organic traffic

Nowadays, most people who are already familiar with your brand will search for it directly on Google. This traffic, which comes from Google's organic search results, should actually be considered **direct** traffic. If not properly categorized, it will be mixed with other organic search traffic and affect the accuracy of your organic TimeScores.

The particularity of this traffic is that the landing-page is always the root domain (e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com`).

To map this traffic, you can create a new channel with the following filter:

- landing_path `equals /`
- utm_source `contains .google.`
- utm_medium `equals referral`
- utm_id_from `does not exist`
