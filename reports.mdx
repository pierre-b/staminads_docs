## Google Ads

The Google Ads report blends data from your Google Ads account with Staminads TimeScores to give you insights on the performance of your campaigns, ad-groups, ads and keywords.

The most important metric here is the Staminads "Cost per minute", which replaces the ROAS metric.

At the campaign level, you can get deeper insights by:
- Device
- Ad network type
- Ad position
- Click type (site links, url, image, product...)
- User list (CRM remarketing)
- OS
- Results page number
- Timezone
- Day of the week
- Hour of the day

At the ad-group level, you can get deeper insights by:
- Landing-page
- Keywords

<Tip>
  Looking at the dimensions having the highest TimeScores can help you identify the ingredients of your most successful campaigns.
