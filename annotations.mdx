Annotations let you mark significant dates on your charts, helping you correlate traffic patterns with real-world events like campaigns, product launches, or website changes.

## Use Cases

- **Campaign launches** — Mark when a new ad campaign started to see its impact on traffic
- **Website changes** — Track deployments, redesigns, or content updates
- **External events** — Note industry events, holidays, or competitor actions
- **Technical issues** — Document outages or tracking issues for future reference
- **Seasonal patterns** — Mark recurring events to compare year-over-year

## Creating an Annotation

Navigate to **Settings > Annotations** in your workspace to manage annotations.

Each annotation includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | The date of the event (YYYY-MM-DD format) |
| **Time** | The specific time of the event (HH:mm format) |
| **Timezone** | The timezone for the event (e.g., America/New_York) |
| **Title** | A short label displayed on the chart |
| **Description** | Optional details about the event |
| **Color** | Custom color for the annotation marker (defaults to #7763f1) |

  />
</Frame>

## Viewing Annotations

Annotations appear as vertical markers on time-series charts. Hover over a marker to see the annotation details.

<Tip>
Use consistent colors to categorize your annotations. For example, use blue for campaigns, green for releases, and red for incidents.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** — Include enough detail in the description to understand the event months later
2. **Use accurate times** — Set the correct timezone to align annotations with your traffic data
3. **Keep titles short** — Use concise titles that fit on the chart without cluttering
4. **Clean up old annotations** — Remove annotations that are no longer relevant to keep charts readable
